# Quick Notes

This application is a useful tool which is designed to create, edit and organise notes in a simple and user-friendly fashion. I was motivated by the idea of having a secure and quick notes taking page, which would help me organise anything I needed to remember. This has been a fantastic demonstration of the power of Express.js and I have throughly enjoyed the process to deliver this final result
